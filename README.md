# solana-workbench-releases

Download the Workbench, report issues, and feature requests here.

Solana Workbench is alpha software. It might be a little rough for a while, and we reserve the right to make changes that could cause a lot of breakage. Eventually, as we smooth out the functionality and design, things will get much more stable.

## Downloads

Downloads are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/workbenchapp/solana-workbench-releases) section.

## Dependencies

Currently, [Docker for Mac/Windows](https://docker.com) is required for the Workbench's local validator functionality to work.

Having the [Anchor](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor) binary available in your `PATH` is also required for the Anchor functionality to work.

## Usage

The [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0V0FcI-upo) is worth a watch to understand how the Workbench is meant to be used. We will get proper docs up eventually.

## Issues

Please file bugs and feature requests in the [Issues](https://github.com/workbenchapp/solana-workbench-releases) section. Your feedback on the product is valued!
